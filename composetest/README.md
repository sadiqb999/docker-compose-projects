This tutorial aims to introduce fundamental concepts of Docker Compose by guiding you through the development of a basic Python web application.

Using the Flask framework, the application features a hit counter in Redis, providing a practical example of how Docker Compose can be applied in web development scenarios.

The concepts demonstrated here should be understandable even if you're not familiar with Python.

This is a non-normative example that just highlights the key things you can do with Compose.
